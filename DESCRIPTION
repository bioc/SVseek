Description: The `SVseek` package analyses structural variants in candidate genes from genomic sequencing data. The software was developed for stranded data generated with a single-primer extension approach, but also supports non-stranded data from other assays. The package detects breakpoints from split reads and calculates variant allele fractions (VAFs).
